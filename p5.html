                <h2>Emotion Classification in Music Using Machine Learning</h2>

                <p>
                    This project is part of the Departmental Honors requirement for the 
                    statistics program at the University of Washington, and alse the project
                    that is used to recieve the STAT 499 credits. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project explores how machine learning models can classify emotions 
                    in music using the Russell Circumplex Emotion model. I used the DEAM 
                    MediaEval dataset from Kaggle, with Marsyas as a tool to extract the 
                    feature of music with several different algorithms, which let me 
                    forms the dataset
                    used in this project. Each song was labeled according to its arousal 
                    and valence levels to classify emotion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I compared two modeling approaches: a LASSO regression model that 
                    separately predicts arousal and valence, then label emotions using the
                    same stanrdard as before, and a multinomial logistic 
                    regression model that directly predicts the emotion category. While 
                    LASSO achieved low mean squared error on arousal and valence, it was 
                    less accurate for emotion classification compared to the multinomial 
                    model.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One challenge I encountered was that although arousal and valence 
                    predictions were relatively accurate, small errors could still lead 
                    to incorrect emotion classification due to the strict boundaries in 
                    the Russell model. This highlighted the difficulty of translating 
                    continuous emotion metrics into discrete categories.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The final report is still in progress.
