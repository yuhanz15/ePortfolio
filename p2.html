                <h2>Modeling Tennis Momentum Shifts</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was carried out as part of the 2024 Mathematical 
                    Contest in Modeling (MCM). I worked in a group of two and was 
                    primarily the one to create the initial momentum flow model, and 
                    was involved in creating predictive models for the analysis and 
                    prediction of alterations in player performance during tennis matches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We initially constructed a mathematical model to quantify momentum 
                    in a match from performance indicators such as point winnings, aces, 
                    double faults, and serving. After we had enhanced the model to better 
                    approximate true patterns of match play, we demonstrated that tennis 
                    momentum is structured and not random.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the momentum model, logistic and linear regression models 
                    for predicting point outcomes and variation in flow were developed. 
                    The models uncovered critical indicators such as server health and 
                    win-game ratio and utilized for examining predictability of change 
                    in momentum in and between games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project deepened my experience in time series modeling, sports 
                    analytics, and collaborative model development under time constraints.
