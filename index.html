              Hi, I'm Yuhan Zhang, a senior undergraduate student at the University of Washington,
              majoring in Statistics. I am also an honor student in the Department of Statistics, 
              where I have the opportunity to deepen my understanding in this area and explore more 
              aspects of this subject. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My primary academic goal is to pursue a PhD in Statistics and contribute to research 
              that advances both the theory and application of statistical methods. WHile I am still 
              exploring specific research directions, I am particularly drawn to the flexibility and 
              impact of statistics in fields raning from scientific discovery to decision-making under 
              uncertainty. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Through my coursework, I have solidified my foundation in mathematical analysis, probability theory and related areas, and I 
              am eager to continue building on these skills as I progress in my studies. I am committed 
              to learning and contributing to the academic community through collaboration and exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond statistics, I usually spend my free time on games I love. Gaming is always one choice for me. 
              One of my favorite game is Maimai, and I participated in e-sports competitions for it, earning third place
              in one of the matches. I also start creating mods for some of my favorite games, enjoying the way that 
              creativity and technical skills together.
