              Welcome to my personal academic website! My name is Yuhan, 
              and I am enthusiastic about pursuing advanced studies in the field of statistics, 
              with a particular goal of earning a Ph.D. in this discipline.
            </p>
            <p>
              My academic journey began with an undergraduate education that introduced me to the power 
              of data and statistical methods. While I have not yet specialized in a specific research area, 
              I am deeply curious about how statistical techniques can be applied to solve diverse and 
              complex problems across disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through my coursework, I have solidified my foundation in mathematical analysis, probability theory and related areas, and I 
              am eager to continue building on these skills as I progress in my studies. I am committed 
              to learning and contributing to the academic community through collaboration and exploration.
