                <h2>Comparative Analysis of SARIMA and ETS Models in Forecasting Influenza Cases</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was completed during the "Online Research Seminar on Time Series
                    Modeling with Application in Economics and Public Health", held in 2024. It focuses 
                    on comparing the performance of two time series models—SARIMA and 
                    ETS—in forecasting monthly influenza cases in China.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using China Public Health Science Data Center, 2012-2018 data, 
                    I formulated and contrasted the two models with regards to their 
                    ability to capture seasonality and predictive power. After fitting 
                    and testing on out-of-sample data, ETS yielded lower RMSE and MAPE 
                    values than SARIMA, which signifies enhanced forecasting accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this project, I gained further insight into time series modeling, 
                    model performance, and the influence of model structures on forecast 
                    outcomes, especially when working with public health data.
