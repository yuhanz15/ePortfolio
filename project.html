            <p>
              This project is a vaccine scheduler built in Java that interacts with an online 
              database to store and manage vaccine-related information. The main goal was to 
              design a simple scheduling tool that could efficiently handle vaccine appointments 
              and streamline the data flow between users and the database.
            </p>
            <p>
              I focused on implementing key functionalities like appointment management, real-time 
              updates to the database, and user-friendly features for scheduling. Working on this 
              project allowed me to improve my Java programming skills and better understand database 
              integration. While there’s more to polish, this was a great hands-on experience in 
              building practical tools with backend logic.

            <p>
              This project focuses on implementing a custom memory allocator in C that serves a 
              similar purpose to the standard malloc and free functions. The program provides 
              memory allocation, deallocation, and efficient management, while maintaining 
              performance and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working on this project allowed me to explore low-level memory management concepts, 
              including designing custom allocation strategies, tracking memory usage, and 
              optimizing the allocation process. It gave me hands-on experience in system programming 
              and a deeper understanding of how dynamic memory management works behind the scenes.

              Modeling Tennis Momentum Shifts
            </h2></a>
            <p>
              This project was done with a university classmate as part of the MCM competition. 
              We aimed to explore and model how "momentum" shifts during a tennis match – a 
              concept often debated among players and coaches. Momentum here refers to patterns 
              in performance where a player’s flow of winning points might change over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started by building a model to visualize performance flow during matches. 
              The first version was too basic, so we improved it by considering more factors 
              like unforced errors, serving effectiveness, and set breaks. The improved model 
              gave us a clearer picture of how momentum changes. Next, we created two 
              predictive models: one using logistic regression to predict if a player would 
              win the next point and another with linear regression to identify momentum shifts. 
              We found key indicators, such as the server advantage and game-winning ratios, 
              that help explain performance changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              While our models didn’t perfectly predict results, they revealed patterns 
              in player performance and provided tools to analyze momentum. This work could 
              be useful for tennis coaches looking to better understand their athletes' 
              strengths and weaknesses during a match.

              Comparative Analysis of SARIMA and ETS Models in Forecasting Influenza Cases in China
            </h2></a>
            <p>
              In this project, I explored two popular time series models, SARIMA and ETS, 
              to forecast monthly influenza cases in China from 2012 to 2018. I wanted to 
              see which model could better capture the seasonal patterns of the data and 
              produce more accurate predictions. After training and testing both models, 
              I found that the ETS model performed better, showing lower errors compared 
              to SARIMA. It was particularly good at capturing the recurring seasonal 
              trends in influenza cases, which I found quite interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working on this project gave me a chance to dive deeper into time series 
              forecasting and understand how statistical models can be applied to 
              real-world public health problems. It was rewarding to see how predictions 
              can provide insights that might help with planning for influenza outbreaks. 
              In the future, I hope to explore more advanced methods and include factors 
              like climate and vaccination rates to see how they impact predictions.
