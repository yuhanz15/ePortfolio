            <p>
              This project is a vaccine scheduler built in Java that interatcs with a database
              with SQL, to store and manage vaccine reservations. Users can create their account, 
              and log in to make and manager their appointments. The program also allow patients 
              to make reservation for a specific care giver, and care givers to manage the 
              spare slots and check the availability of each vaccines. The program also has 
              basic error messages, to help users understand what is wrong with the interaction.

            <a href="p2.html"><h2>Modeling Tennis Momentum Shifts</h2></a>
            <p>
              This project was done with one of my classmates as part of the MCM competition. 
              We aimed to explore and model how "momentum" shifts during a tennis match, which is a 
              concept often debated among players and coaches. Momentum here refers to patterns 
              in performance where a player's flow of winning points might change over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started by building a model to visualize performance flow during matches. 
              The first version was too basic, so we improved it by considering more factors 
              like unforced errors, serving effectiveness, and set breaks. The improved model 
              gave us a clearer picture of how momentum changes. Next, we created two 
              predictive models: one using logistic regression to predict if a player would 
              win the next point and another with linear regression to identify momentum shifts. 
              We found key indicators, such as the server advantage and game-winning ratios, 
              that help explain performance changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              While our models didn't perfectly predict results, they revealed patterns 
              in player performance and provided tools to analyze momentum. This work could 
              be useful for tennis coaches looking to better understand their athletes' 
              strengths and weaknesses during a match.

              Comparative Analysis of SARIMA and ETS Models in Forecasting Influenza Cases in China
            </h2></a>
            <p>
              In this project, I explored two popular time series models, SARIMA and ETS, 
              to forecast monthly influenza cases in China from 2012 to 2018. I wanted to 
              see which model could better capture the seasonal patterns of the data and 
              produce more accurate predictions. After training and testing both models, 
              I found that the ETS model performed better, showing lower errors compared 
              to SARIMA. It was particularly good at capturing the recurring seasonal 
              trends in influenza cases, which I found quite interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working on this project gave me a chance to dive deeper into time series 
              forecasting and understand how statistical models can be applied to 
              real-world public health problems. It was rewarding to see how predictions 
              can provide insights that might help with planning for influenza outbreaks. 
              In the future, I hope to explore more advanced methods and include factors 
              like climate and vaccination rates to see how they impact predictions.

            <a href="p4.html"><h2>Modeling Medical Charges Using Linear Regression and Group Splitting</h2></a>
            <p>
              In this project, I focused on building a predictive model for individual medical charges based 
              on factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and number of children. After initial model 
              fitting, I noticed that several variables were not significant predictors, so I performed variable 
              selection to simplify the model and improve interpretability.
              Through analyzing the residuals and scatter plots, I identified that the data naturally 
              split into groups, especially between smokers and non-smokers, and further among smokers 
              based on BMI levels. After cross-validation, I determined the optimal grouping and created a new 
              linear model based on these splits. This approach significantly improved model performance, with 
              an adjusted R-squared of over 0.86.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although I attempted a Box-Cox transformation to further refine the model, it did not 
              substantially improve residual normality. Therefore, the final model remained on the original 
              scale. This project deepened my understanding of model selection, group-based modeling 
              strategies, and the balance between model complexity and interpretability.

            <a href="p5.html"><h2>Emotion Classification in Music Using Machine Learning</h2></a>
            <p>
              This project explores how machine learning models can classify music based on emotions using the 
              Thayer-Russell plane. I built a dataset by enhancing the DEAM MediaEval dataset with additional 
              audio features extracted using the Marsyas software. Each song was labeled according to arousal and valence values, 
              leading to a fine-grained emotion categorization.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two approaches in this project were compared: a LASSO regression model that predicts arousal 
              and valence separately, and a multinomial logistic regression model that directly classifies emotions. 
              While the LASSO model achieved low prediction errors for arousal and valence, the multinomial logistic model 
              demonstrated better overall accuracy in direct emotion classification. This project highlights the challenges and 
              potential strategies in modeling emotional responses to music.

            <a href="p6"><h2>Custom Memory Management in C</h2></a>
            <p>
              This project implements a memory management system in C, focusing on efficient 
              memory allocation, deallocation, and management. The system provides an alternative 
              to standard memory management functions like malloc and free, offering users greater 
              control over memory usage. It includes key features such as a custom allocator to handle 
              memory blocks, mechanisms to detect and manage those blocks, adn methods to optimize memory 
              utilization. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The program interacts directly with the system memory using low-level operations, 
              allowing users to allocate and release memory dynamically. It also includes error 
              handling to prevent issues such as memory leaks and invalid access, ensuring 
              stability and reliability. Designed to demonstrate a deeper understanding of 
              memory management concepts, this project showcases how custom allocators can 
              improve performance and address specific application requirements.
