            <p>
              This project is a vaccine scheduler built in Java that interacts with a database 
              with SQL, to store and manage vaccine reservations. Users can create their account, 
              and log in to make and manage their appointments. The program also allows patients 
              to make reservations for a specific care giver, and care givers to manage the 
              spare slots and check the availability of each vaccine. The program also has 
              basic error messages, to help users understand what is wrong with the interaction.

            <p>  
              This project was completed as part of the MCM competition. We built 
              mathematical models to track and predict momentum shifts during tennis 
              matches, using logistic and linear regression approaches. By incorporating 
              indicators such as serving effectiveness, unforced errors, and game-winning 
              ratios, we explored how player performance changes over time and identified 
              key patterns that contribute to momentum.

              Comparative Analysis of SARIMA and ETS Models in Forecasting Influenza Cases in China
            </h2></a>
            <p>
              This project compares SARIMA and ETS models in forecasting monthly influenza 
              cases in China from 2012 to 2018. After evaluating both models, I found that 
              ETS provided more accurate predictions and captured seasonal trends more 
              effectively. The project demonstrates how time series modeling can be used 
              to analyze public health data and support outbreak planning.

            <p>
              This project focused on predicting individual medical charges using factors 
              such as age, BMI, smoking status, and number of children. By identifying 
              natural groupings in the data and refining the model through variable 
              selection and cross-validation, I developed a group-based linear regression 
              model that significantly improved prediction accuracy, achieving an adjusted 
              R-squared over 0.86.

            <p>
              This project applies machine learning models to classify music based on 
              emotions using the Thayer-Russell model. By enhancing the DEAM dataset with 
              extracted audio features, I trained and compared LASSO and multinomial 
              logistic regression models. The results showed that while LASSO performed 
              well in predicting arousal and valence, multinomial regression offered 
              better accuracy in direct emotion classification.

            <p>
              This project implements a memory management system in C, focusing on efficient 
              memory allocation, deallocation, and management. The system provides an alternative 
              to standard memory management functions like malloc and free, offering users greater 
              control over memory usage. It includes key features such as a custom allocator to handle 
              memory blocks, mechanisms to detect and manage those blocks, adn methods to optimize memory 
              utilization. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The program interacts directly with the system memory using low-level operations, 
              allowing users to allocate and release memory dynamically. It also includes error 
              handling to prevent issues such as memory leaks and invalid access, ensuring 
              stability and reliability. Designed to demonstrate a deeper understanding of 
              memory management concepts, this project showcases how custom allocators can 
              improve performance and address specific application requirements.
