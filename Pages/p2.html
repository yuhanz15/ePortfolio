                <h2>Alzheimer's Disease Classification with Random Forest</h2>
                <p>
                  This project was done for the final assignment in BIOST 546. The goal was 
                  to build a model that can tell if a person has Alzheimer's disease based on 
                  data from brain scans. The dataset has 360 numerical features for each person,
                  and each sample is labeled as having Alzheimer's or not. Because of privacy, 
                  the data cannot be shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I chose to use a Random Forest model because it works well with a lot of 
                  features and can show which ones are important. The dataset had more 
                  Alzheimer's cases than non-Alzheimer's, so I used the ROSE method to make 
                  the classes more balanced by generating new samples. After cleaning the 
                  data and splitting it into training and testing sets, I trained the model 
                  in R with 500 trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The model did well, with about 91% accuracy on the test set. I also looked 
                  at which features were the most important in the classification. This 
                  project helped me practice how to work with imbalanced data, choose a model, 
                  and evaluate the results. It also made me think more about how machine 
                  learning can be used in medical research.
                </p>
