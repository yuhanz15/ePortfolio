                <h2>Medical Cost Modeling and Group-Based Prediction</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was completed as part of the coursework for STAT 423 
                    at the University of Washington. Working with teammates, I 
                    contributed mainly to the model refinement and subgroup analysis 
                    portions of the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to build a predictive model for 
                    individual medical charges based on factors such as age, BMI, 
                    smoking status, and number of children. Using the Medical Cost 
                    Personal Dataset, we first conducted exploratory data analysis, 
                    assessed correlations, and built initial linear regression models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Focusing on improving model performance, I led the effort 
                    to refine the predictors, identify groupings based on BMI 
                    and smoking status, and fit an updated model that significantly 
                    improved the explained variance. Our final model separated 
                    patients into three groups and achieved an adjusted R-squared 
                    of over 0.86.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I gained deeper experience in model 
                    selection, group-based modeling strategies, and interpreting 
                    residual patterns to guide model improvements.
